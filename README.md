# Databases-Course

Welcome to the repository containing my projects for the Databases 2 course. This repository showcases the assignments and projects I developed during the semester, exploring various types of databases and advanced database concepts.

## Course Description
The Databases 2 course offers an in-depth exploration of different database technologies and their applications. Students learn about traditional relational databases as well as specialized databases for spatial data, graph data, and document-oriented data. The course also covers data warehousing, indexing techniques, and working with lightweight databases like SQLite. Through practical assignments and projects, students gain hands-on experience with diverse database systems and learn to leverage their unique capabilities to solve complex data management problems.
